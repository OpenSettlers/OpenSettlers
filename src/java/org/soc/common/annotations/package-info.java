/*
 * Some static annotation definitions for javadoc:
 * 
 * @see http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?FixmeComment
 * Verbatim copy:
 * TODO: How about auto-correcting small spelling errors? 
 * FIXME: This won't work if the file is missing. 
 * XXX: This method badly needs refactoring: should switch by core type. <mbp> 
 * 
 * TODO [pritiority] adds a prio annotation to the javadoc tag.
 * This should make easy sorting possible in rendered task lists
 * Definitions of priority:
 * 1-10 Must have
 * 11-100 Should have
 * 101-1000 Could have
 * 1001+ Would
 *
